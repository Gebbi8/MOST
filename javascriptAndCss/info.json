By clicking, you get further information about the actual diff below the donut chart. Even more details are available when clicking the Report-button afterwards.",

	"heatmapVis": "The heatmap visualises all diffs between the model versions in the selected data set. The colors indicate whether a diff is an insert (green), a delete (red), a move (blue), or an update (yellow). The models are randomly placed on the x-axis. Be aware that the y-axis is a log-scale. Therefor the colored parts of the bars are not easily visual comparable.",

	"boxplot1Vis": "The boxplot visualises the numbers of diff operations in the data set by their quartiles, and it shows the data variability outside the upper and lower quartile using whiskers. The single fields show the numbers for BiVeS diffs by type: Moves (blue), inserts (green), deletes (red), updates (yellow). The x-axis shows the number of diffs. Logarithmic scale can be turned on and off.",
