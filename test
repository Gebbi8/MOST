Research Interest

Graphical representation of  of the evolution of computational models.

The number of models describing biological systems rises permanently. Also these models change overtime revealing information about the evolution of biological systems.
As it is complicated to extract such knowledge from large tables in which each line is a comparison between two version of one model, visualization of this data can be helpful to communicate information easily. Due to constant change in the models, visualizations should be able to be updated based the new data.
Those graphical representations can be used for posters and presentations as well as websites. For the last one the visualizations could be extended to enable interactive exploration, so users can gain more information about the matter.
