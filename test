Research Interest

Graphical representation of  of the evolution of computational models.

The number of models describing biological systems rises permanently. Also these models change over time revealing information about the evolution of our understanding of biological systems.

Investigations of open model repositories produced much data, in which it is complicated to extract knowledge about the evolution. Therefore i develop visualization of this data, that can be helpful to communicate information easily. Due to constant change in the models, visualizations should be able to be updated based on new data.
Those graphical representations can be used for posters and presentations as well as websites. For the last one the visualizations could be extended to enable interactive exploration, so users can gain more information about the matter.

* also -> in addition

* "revealing information about the evolution of biological systems" ist
nicht richtig, denk ich. wir lernen nicht wie die systeme evolved sind,
sondern wie unser verstaendis ueber die systeme evolved.

* ich wuerde das dann so aufziehen, dass investigations of open model
repositories jede menge daten ueber die evolution revealed haben, und um
die zu verstehen/daraus schlau zu werden entwickelst du jetzt
moeglichkeiten um die daten zu visualisieren.
